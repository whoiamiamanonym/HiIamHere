Welcome to the Valheim Closed Beta!

Currently there are five Biomes implemented in a somewhat complete state; these being Meadows, Black Forest, Swamp, Mountains, and Heathlands. There are other Biomes farther out towards the edge of the world but these are currently pretty light in content, although you can still access them. We hope you will have fun exploring!

There will be bugs, missing content, crashes, and other issues present in this Beta. We may also make sweeping changes to World Generation which can possibly corrupt your existing worlds.

We will be collecting anonymous gameplay-related data during the Closed Beta.

If you have any feedback or would like to help us by submitting a bug report, please use the 'valheim-beta'-channel on the Valheim Discord server.
